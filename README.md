# Cyclic Dungeon Generation Prototype in SDL2 - Procedural Generation

Graph grammar can be used for a variety of purposes, such as level generation, item generation, and quest structure generation. The inspiration for this project stems from the game Unexplored, with the primary goal of gaining a deeper understanding of Graph Grammar, Cyclic Dungeon Generation, and procedural generation.
